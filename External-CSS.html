        <h1>Introduction to External CSS</h1>
        <p>External CSS is a method of styling web pages where the style rules (CSS) are stored in a separate file, distinct from the HTML structure file. This file is saved with a .css extension and linked to the HTML document via a <link> tag placed in the <head> section. It is considered the best practice for professional, multi-page web development, as it allows for site-wide styling changes from a single file</p>
